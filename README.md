# Your-Personal-Work-Day-Schedular
Creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## How to use


To add an event, simply click in the empty space next to the hour you want to schedule the event. Type the information and click the "Save" button to the right.

Note: You can not add a new event to any times in the past. If you try, you'll get a notification pop-up and the text will clear from the field.

If you need to change the details of an event, click on the event and make your changes. Then click on "Save." Your updated event will be listed.

If you need to delete an event, simply click the delete button at the right of the row.

If you leave the page and come back, your events will still be listed for you to keep track of.
